# CHALLENGES 
# The logic of the cities section, where I get an error, took me a bit of time to comprehend and address. I have restricted the number of citiies while I troubleshoot this 
# There is still a logic issue wherein if I am unable to get the nearest city and the lists 
# vary in size, the weather dictionary errors out 
# In the vacation section, I try to drop the nas so as not to mark a non exsistent hotel 
# and it doesnÂ´t, even when that is turned into a dataframe
